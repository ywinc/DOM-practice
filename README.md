BVT Practice

Languages: HTML, JS

It should be some simple HTML and the project should contain a script.js file that has code that creates and modifies your HTML elements on the web page.  
This does not need to be beautiful it can be messy or simple the point is to put some time in writing out query selectors and interacting with the DOM.
